// TAXONOMY (P'Aim, revised 11 ก.ค. — see docs/ds/home-redesign.md §Taxonomy REVISED):
// the home groups songs by their REAL book = the `category` column (3 books), NOT by
// `book_refs`. A song lives in exactly one category, so no song appears in two เล่ม.
// `book_refs` (ล/ย/ยอ/ม/ส/…) are demoted to reference TAGS shown on the song ("อยู่ใน
// เล่มเล็ก 282") — handled in the component via bookCodes.js, not here.

// Ordering is NOT this file's job (B131) — it comes from the shared lib/songSort.js so the
// bookshelf, the pickers and the shared lists all order songs by the same rules.
